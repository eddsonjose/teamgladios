    <p>Social media platforms have been evolving since the start of the digital age. Users, globally from different age ranges, are trusting these platforms with their personal information in successfully creating their accounts. But what if the most popular social media platform leaks your valuable personal information?</p>
    <p>Facebook is an online social media and social networking service founded by Mark Zuckerberg in 2004. It is one of the most popular social media being used worldwide. In the quarter year of 2019, 2.41 billion users have been active on Facebook. Facebook is an online community that many users use to communicate around the world without any fees. Most users are left in the unknown that they are actually giving something in return to be able to use Facebook which is their data. For Facebook, our data is very valuable information to them. Facebook can use our data in many ways such as data mining, marketing personal information, and creating algorithms. The algorithm Facebook creates targets the users by showing the users what they desire based on their likes. This causes an addiction for the users and allows Facebook to gain more data from them. It becomes an inescapable cycle of addiction. Under the case that there are more and more Facebook users, Facebook as social media provides people with a virtual platform, which enables people to find a new "world" here. In this world, people are willing to enjoy and share lives and satisfy their vanity; because they can get likes and comments. However, under such behavior, people will disguise themselves and pretend to be the person that most people like, which is not the real self. In a world where vanity is constantly being met, people are beginning to become morbid, and many social problems started occurring. The author James Bridle mentions in his book, New Dark Age- and the end of the future, on why technology is creating a ‘dark age.’ The idea of Facebook not being considered an existing facet, questions Bridles formulated thought of data being possibly manipulated or used wrongly, as mentioned in his book. Perhaps without Facebook, present problems involving personal data and social problems would be evitable.
</p>
<p>Many Facebook users are inputting their data into Facebook. Without knowing, the users are sharing their data around the whole world. Many users do not know about the private settings in Facebook. Even though there are privacy settings, the data is still being shared.</p>
<p>Facebook is selling data to the marketplace for the matchmaking to advertisement. There was a survey taken and that not many Facebook users know about the Application Programming Interface is used to access the users information. Facebook has allowed third- party applications in the system. This meant those third- party applications have accessed to any users personal data. Facebook has the option of only allowing “Friends only” to access profile but that still allows third- party applications that their friends are using to access the personal information. There is a magazine called Consumer Reports Magazine and they discuss a study about Facebook privacy in January 2012, “Almost 13 million users said they had never set, or didn’t know about, Facebook’s privacy tools. And 28 % shared all, or almost all, of their wall posts with an audience wider than just their friends.”</p>
<p>Facebook has the option for users to disable or delete their account. However, the comments and media that were posted cannot be removed. They will forever remain in Facebook’s database. Facebook has claimed that the media is inaccessible however Facebook still allowed entry for the satisfaction even when the account has been deleted. Facebook not only takes those data but also takes the information we share such as links, connections, locations, and many more. They will use these information and give them to advertisers even if the account has been disabled or deleted.
Facebook has stated how there will be privacy protection but there hasn’t been any protection at all. What’s worse is that the data we input in the Facebook system will remain in their database forever for other users, third- app applications, and advertisers to see, to use, or to collect.</p>

<p> As the number of Facebook users are rapidly growing, the amount of data being handled by the company is increasingly growing as well. For the past few years, Facebook faced numerous issues and scandals that brought their data collection into the spotlight. Different issues involving data harvesting and data privacy were huge topics when it came to discussion. These issues heavily impacted their reputation and the public’s trust.
In the year 2007, Facebook users were introduced to Beacon, an online feature that shared one’s facebook user activity to their news feed. These activities were created through external websites which was unknowingly published and advertised. This controversy was a huge issue as it affected one’s privacy. Facebook users became aware of this situation and demanded that the social media site should not publish any of their activities from external websites. This resulted in a lawsuit, which was called Lane v. Facebook, inc. This whole issue resulted in Facebook paying $9.5 million, and Mark Zuckerberg apologizing to the public. The problems regarding data privacy just started to go publicly after the Beacon issue. According to the New York Times, several complaints were filed which resulted in an investigation led by the Federal Trade Commision in Washington. After resolving the issues involving data privacy, Facebook had a complete data management transformation in December 2009. The Federal Trade Commission created terms of settlement in the future if Facebook breaks any rules and regulations (Sengupta). </p>
<p>In 2013, 6 million users of this popular social media site was exposed to the public. Their private information, containing their phone numbers and email addresses became accessible to the public. According to Facebook’s White Hat Program, there was a bug released and it allowed users to access other user’s information if it had some sort of connection with the other user. The released bug stored people’s contact information from the user’s Facebook account through the DYI (Download Your Information) tool. This was a major issue as it affected users worldwide. One of the biggest privacy problems that Facebook has faced is the Cambridge Analytica issue. This mainly started in the year 2014, which involved a plugin app to a user’s Facebook account. Aleksandr Kogan asked users to complete a survey for money. This survey required users to add in a plugin to their Facebook. This plugin required uses to provide their personal data from Facebook. This transaction was illegal and was against their privacy rules. Facebook banned Kogan’s app from Facebook’s platform and administered Kogan to delete all the gathered information. This on-going problem appeared again in 2018 which was exposed by the news platform, The Guardian and The New York Times. These platforms exposed that Cambridge Analytica harvested information from 50 million Facebook users. This information was supported by Christopher Wylie, the creator of the plugin, thisisyourdigitallife. The data from the banned app was purchased by Cambridge Analytica. This organization was also accused of targeting users with various pro-Trump advertising, which sparked more controversies. The Cambridge Analytica issue became a hot topic, and Facebook released statements to sue the news platform that exposed them. The Federal Trade Commission played a key role in the investigation if Facebook violated terms once again.
Throughout the year 2018, several investigations happened. The FBI and the Justice Department became more involved with the Cambridge Analytica issue. United Kingdom’s Information Commissioner’s Office fined Facebook £500,000 for their connection with the data scandal. More evidence were published including both user and employee interviews, projects conducted by Facebook management and their relationships with other organizations and government. This year, specifically on July 24, 2019— The Federal Trade Commision announced a $5 billion settlement with Facebook. This settlement involves the privacy violations that the company has made throughout the years. The issues surrounding data privacy between Facebook and external parties have been going on for years. User information has been gathered by different parties with no consent or permission. The violations created by Facebook are very harmful, as it shows irresponsibility to its users. It also impacts the user’s trust and their loyalty to their platform.</p>

<p>When Sherry Turkle first gave a speech at TED, her topic was "Celebrating our life on the Internet," but now she believes that the Internet is "bringing us to places we don't want to go." This is what is happening now to Facebook. Under the case that there are more and more Facebook users, Facebook as social media provides people with a virtual platform, which enables people to find a new "world" here. In this world, people are willing to enjoy and share lives and satisfy their vanity; because they can get likes and comments. However, under such behavior, people will disguise themselves and pretend to be the person that most people like, which is not the real self. In a world where vanity is constantly being met, people are beginning to become morbid, and many social problems started occurring. Facebook took us to this "place".</p>
<p>Recently, a group of people brings an online community on Facebook. They pretend that they are at the Facebook platform before 2012 and then they pretend that they all have a certain role that existed before 2012 to play in a group, using the way how people use Facebook before 2012 to chat and act on current Facebook. They believe that people are attracted to closed communities because social media has evolved into a political battlefield. The role of such group dyeing on Facebook brings fresh air to people and helps them eliminate the pressure of certain emotional labor. (web article). It is not difficult to see that people's desires will always develop and extend. When they are unable to be satisfied through the things they have now, they will try to find another way to satisfy themselves, and Facebook provides them with such a platform. At the same time, people will use this platform to try to escape the reality that they are dissatisfied or unwilling to face. Just like people in this group want to escape certain pressures and phenomena in their real-life (such as they don’t like that Facebook is becoming a political battlefield). So they have created such a role-playing platform. This sounds like a self-deception.</p>
<p>As we all know, Facebook has acquired Instagram in 2012, and the popularity of Instagram occurred after it was acquired by Facebook. When users posting photos on Instagram, they can photoshop their pictures and add texts that are matching the picture. Users can show the best thing they have on this platform, but are these absolutely true? Not really. What they want is to get likes and comments because these users are eager to get attention. At the same time, when the photos can't be appreciated -- there are not enough likes and comments, then the users believe that they don't get enough attention from others. So they will be very lost, sad and depressed because they can't accept being ignored, even if this is what everyday life is like in reality. Is such a mentality really healthy?</p>

<p>How and why has the Facebook franchise reached its grandeur position in mainstream societal networking? Its roots stem from 2004 and is currently one of the most checked on social platforms for the reason that people can communicate in a way that is in a sense more entertaining. Of course,  cause of its popularity and likeness from all over the world, people seem to forget the troublesome situations that being a part of Facebook signifies. The author James Bridle approached the topic deeply in his book New Dark Age. In his book along with interviews about to it, he mentions that the gathering of data or how he refers to it- Big data, is essentially computational thinking. It is the belief that the world can be reduced to data and modeled to be completely understood. The idea derives from enlightenment, in which the more we know, the more control we have over it. However, as much as the concept seems valid, it is becoming more evident that it isn’t exactly the case. In one of his examples, he states that weather predictions fall under this category. Meteorologists know about the weather and can predict the forecast from data collected but the results are not always accurate. To his point, we do face a future in which we have more data about the world and yet we know less about it. When it comes to facebook, data collecting is obvious and a huge concern for many users. Even more so because the ‘data’ that is collected is personal information. If Facebook didn’t exist, then would fewer data of ourselves be roaming around? And is this ‘data’ useful at all? Some marketing companies can agree that yes, in fact, it is. Platforms such as Facebook, and Instagram, use certain mechanisms to get people to keep checking these apps and they use it to their advantage to hack the brains of millions in return for advertising revenue.</p>
